From time to time, Dev Dreams may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Dev Dreams also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://dreamsof.dev blog posts. Dev Dreams only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.
