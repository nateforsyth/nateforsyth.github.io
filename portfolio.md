title: In-flight and portfolio pieces

Throughout my dev journey, I've observed that it's vitally important to keep learning and pushing yourself - it doesn't always need to be relevant to your career trajectory, you simply need to regularly be doing *something*.

This page organises the projects I am working on, consider all of them WIP unless in a section that implies otherwise.

## Learning

The learning pieces on this page are intended to show the progress I make so I can look back later on to see how far I've come.

As part of the [Unity Essentials Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials), you must create a simple physics based scene where the goal is to ensure that the ball doesn't touch the *lava*.
