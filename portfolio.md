Throughout my dev journey, I've observed that it's vitally important to keep learning and pushing yourself - it doesn't always need to be relevant to your career trajectory, you simply need to regularly be doing *something*.

This page organises the projects I am working on, consider all of them WIP unless in a section that implies otherwise.

## Learning

The learning pieces on this page are intended to show the progress I make so I can look back later on to see how far I've come.

Many of these start off as very basic, however I'm following a series of Learning Paths for Unity intended to ensure that motivation isn't lost.

### Unity

#### 2, Games

##### 2a, Feed the animals

As part of the [Unity Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer), the second tutorial has you creating your first feature rich game. specifically a simple game where animals rush towards you and you need to *feed* them by firing a food item at them.

#### 1, Scenes

##### 1c, Mod the cube

As part of the [Unity Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer), the final quiz for the `Create with Code 1` module tutorial has you modifying an existing scene.

This is the first introduction to using a script to generate a [Primitive Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/510/Documentation/Manual/PrimitiveObjects.html).

##### 1b, The floor is lava

As part of the [Unity Essentials Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials), the second tutorial has you creating a simple 2D scene reminiscent of *Pachinko*, which uses various standard 2D components to bounce a *ball* around obstacles, trying to reach the boxes at the bottom.

##### 1a, The floor is lava

As part of the [Unity Essentials Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials), you must create a simple physics based scene where the goal is to ensure that the ball doesn't touch the *lava*.
