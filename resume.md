## Career Objective

I'm a formally trained Intermediate .NET and Java Developer. With a recent focus on Azure, .NET and SharePoint development, my greatest skills revolve around the Microsoft eco-system including all things Azure. I seek to further refine my Web Application/API development and front-end Web dev skills. I am also keenly interested in Android development, whether native or cross-platform.

My ambition and objective is to fully flesh out my technical skills. I believe that my previous business experience and love of & aptitude in software development has set me up for a bright future within these fields.


## Strengths

I write code clearly and concisely, listen attentively and speak effectively. I have a keen ability to identify problems as well as key requirements, which allow me to provide accurate estimations, and in turn design and deliver well built software, workflows, processes and solutions. I am accoutable, confident in my skills and take responsibility for my actions. I work well with others and confidently motivate and coach others to meet group and team goals while also enjoying ourselves.


## A brief history

I left my previous Data Analysis and Process Improvement career in 2014 to study development full-time. Since graduation in 2016 I've run my own business (which ultimately failed) and have entered the professional work-force with a SharePoint consultancy in Christchurch.

I've worked in both the private and public sectors, both for large New Zealand companies such as Christchurch Casinos, Kathmandu and Transpower as well as small team environments.

Significant projects have been successfully delivered for well-known New Zealand companies such as AsureQuality, Ballantynes, Fulton Hogan, Jade Software, MainPower, Ravensdown, Scenic Hotel Group and Trojan Holdings.
