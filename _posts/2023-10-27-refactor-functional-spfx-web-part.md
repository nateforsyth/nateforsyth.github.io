In this post, I'll guide you through the process refactoring a boilerplate React class component within an SPFx project to be a functional component. In doing so, I'll highlight why this is, in my opinion, the best approach from simplicity, readability and extensibility perspectives.


### Refactoring class components

### What you'll learn in this video:

1) Adding a new Web Part to an existing SPFx project.
2) Understanding of one of the lifecycle methods in React class components; componentDidUpdate. Invoked whenever an update is passed to the component.
3) How to refactor a class component into a functional component.
4) How to implement the useEffect hook.
5) Simulate a REST API call and delay updating of the interface.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have refactored a class component to being a functional component and applied some conditional rendering on SharePoint DOM elements.
