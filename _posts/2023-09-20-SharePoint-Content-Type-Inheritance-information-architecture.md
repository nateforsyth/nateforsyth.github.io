Planning is 80% of a successful project - this is something that still resonates from my first boss in 365 land. This resonates now more than ever as the eco-system transitions further into self-service, specifically with SharePoint. I want to focus this post on inheritance structures for Content Types and why it's important.

# Content Types

Content Type IDs may be a bit of a mystery to some, others are likely well aware - either way, it's very useful to understand how all this works.

I've observed in a across a few of our clients that either they or we have created Content Types in an unexpected (and unsupported) way, using the correct Columns, however they've not derived from any parent Content Type - this is causing no end of problems for our products that , and is not a supported configuration.

Have a good one!
